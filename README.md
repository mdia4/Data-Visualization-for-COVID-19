# Data-Visualization-for-COVID-19
### Business Question
COVID-19 has taken ahold of communities globally, its incredibly high contagion rate demanding unprecented and rapid action on the part of citizens, companies and especially governments. Although a number of visualizations on the COVID-19 spread exist on international levels, understanding how this has played out on a county level is especiall important for local governors and municipal leaders. Since states have been given so much agency under the current administration, and have followed a myriad of different policies, visualizing this data on a smaller scale is crucial to understand efficiency and evaluate local needs. Thus our business question is: **How can we visualize and better understand the overall toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on US counties or county equivalents?**

### Data Questions
1. Which data and metrics can we use to answer out business question?
2. What metrics our missing to our analysis that could help us answer the business question?
3. What kind of COVID-19 progression is shown by our visualizations? Which areas are least targeted and which are most?

### Data Answers
We can come to a number of conclusions based on our data visualizations:
1. All three graphs show that (but especially the bubble and density graphs) show that areas with large international airports are heavily affected, and were the source of the start of the spread.
2. While some areas are starkly affected, others remain completely blank on all graphs, meaning no cases have been reported (or that testing is not ongoing.)
3. Growth was much slower in certain "starting" areas, but grew exponentially in others (such as New York) What is at the root of this? Is it simply the sheer population and urban design of certain cities that is not conducive to distancing? Or has policy played a substantial role in reducing cases? 
- Another important visualization that could have been performed was to look at spread as a result of stay-at home policy. Incorporating that into our visualization would help directly seek out the impact of policy. Including other factors, such as hospital beds, economic income, and even party affiliation, could help draw a more precise picture of what could have helped push or stifle COVID-19 spread. A joint model of the data from our first python execution, and this one for example, would be a step in the right direction.
4. Based on the number of counties and municipalities that have no reported cases, another important point of data would be to look at rates of testing per 1000 for each county. Not just confirmed cases, but testing in general, in order to determine if certain counties' numbers seem inflated simply because they have more confirmed cases.

### Business Answer 

Our data visualizations are important for county and state leadership because if gives them a sense of a) how fast COVID-19 is spreading in their communities b) how their stay-at-home (or lack there-of) policies are affecting the spread c) how they fare compared to neighborhing counties, and who they should reach out to for assistance. This also helps business owners by giving them an idea of how long they should feel directly and strongly affected by the spread, and how they can work with leadership to minimize loss. Still, this merely shows the spread and number of cases, we would need other data points (such as those mentioned above) to connect this spread, to other risk factors in communities that can further contagion.
